Slow IO operations are handled through events or callbacks. Node's event loop 
comes from the idea that the largest waste in computer programmig comes
from waiting for the I/O operations to a complete.

Event loop
It is the entity that handles external events and convert them into callback events.

A function should always be either sync or async.(This does not make async
This does not make much of the sense to me when I read it however 
check the nextTick.js
)
